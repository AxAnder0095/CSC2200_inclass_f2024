    1. I didnt end up finishing the bonus score and reloading data when it pertains to kept new colored dice. <br>
    I was having trouble in other areas and didn't have the time to implement them correctly. <br>
    I also needed to change the background color of the dice for 3 and 4 of a kind but I also had a little <br>
    with implementing them as well. <br>
    2. The main data structure used in my javascript code was an object literal that held all the <br>
    relevant functions and properties for the program to run efficiently. I also used event handlers for <br>
    checking when certain buttons were pressed. Each even handler had their own way of obtaining the correct score.<br>
    3. Things i learned from this project was getting a better understanding of how object work in javascript. <br>
    It took me a little while to understand how they work but once i did, i ended up liking them more than <br>
      traditional objects. Another thing I learned was how to use flex boxes way better than my first time using them.
